                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>
                    SCE Soc is the Carleton Systems and Computer Engineering Society. We are the society for everybody
                    in the Faculty of Systems and Computer Engineering (SCE) which includes the Biomedical and Electrical,
                    Communications, Computer Systems, and Software Engineering streams. <br>
                    The story of the initial push of SCE Soc is kind of funny. A large group of first years in the
                    Software and Computer Systems Engineering streams were looking for SCE Soc during the first year
                    conference. When they found out that it had been defunct for a few years, they berated the first
                    years they knew on how they would be able to start their own society. After struggling to create the
                    society, a few of the upper years were able to swoop in and save the day. As a group, we found it
                    jarring that there was no specialized society for our faculty streams. We technically fall under
                    IEEE but that was focused more towards the Faculty of Electronics rather our own faculty.
                </p>
                <h2> What SCESOC is like, and what we focus on</h2>
                <p>
                    The new SCE Soc will be very similar to the old SCE Soc where we want a society that will encourage
                    both social and academic growth of our members. There is only one real difference between the new
                    and old SCE Soc. The old SCE Soc stood for Software and Computer Engineering Society and they
                    concentrated more on the Software and Computer System Engineering streams. The new SCE Soc will be
                    facilitating to the entire SCE faculty. <br>Like the old SCE Soc, we will be organizing social and
                    academic events like study groups, workshops, help sessions from upper years and professors/TAs as
                    well as social events. As this is our first year and we are a small society at the moment, we are
                    going to focus on more social events to get more interest and participation in the society. In the
                    future, we will want to organize things like conferences, networking events. We will are also
                    interested in starting a test library and a collection of internship/co-op contacts that our members
                    will be able to utilize.
